                <b>Stuart Foy</b> is a <b>Creative Innovation Designer</b> <i>(or Creative Technologist, or Content Creator, or Designer, or Creative, or Motion Designer depending on the day)</i>.<br><br>
                They're currently at <a class="inlinelink" href="https://www.tandpgroup.com/">T&P</a> where they've been since 2018 and has lived through enough name changes that they've lost count.<br><br>
                They love to play with new technlogy, old technlogy and things in general. They started their career as a designer but realised they loved doing too many things to stay in a single discipline.<br><br>
                Outside of work they can be found playing <a class="inlinelink" href="http://instagram.com/p/DJy18t8oRZj/">DanceDanceRevolution</a>  at the arcade, enjoying standup comedy, going on long walks with their camera, supporting 2025 Scottish Cup Winnners Aberdeen and enjoying all things cute and fun.
