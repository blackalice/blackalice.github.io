Extremly niche, but super cool to see how I've improved as a player over time! Likely wouldn't exist if the server owner just made an API, you know?"

        <p><b>The Brief</b></p>
        <p>Create a customizable video to send to Coutts customers applying for a product. The video needed to have customizable sections of text, and not be overly distracting to ensure the customer listens to the voiceover (as the video doubled up as a legal document).</p>
        <p><b>The Solution</b></p>
        <p>Take the bees wax sculpture commissioned for Coutts, the debit card visual and bring it to life in 3D. By creating a selection of different shots the video can be lengthened or shortened depending on the customer. Simple animated text frames are interspersed, depending on the voice over.</p>
